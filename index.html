                <h2>1. Seal Windows and Doors to Keep Water Out</h2>
                <h3>Why It’s Important:</h3>
                <p>
                    Unsealed windows and doors can allow water to seep in, damaging walls, floors, and furniture. Proper sealing to keep water out protects your home’s interior and structure.
                </p>
                <h3>How to Seal Windows and Doors:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Inspect for Gaps and Cracks:</b> Look for any visible gaps around windows and doors. These can be sealed with weather-resistant caulk or weather-stripping.</li>
                    <li><b>Add Storm Shutters or Window Film:</b> For homes in high-wind areas, adding storm shutters or applying window film can provide an extra layer of protection.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <b>Bonus Tip:</b> Consider hiring a professional to inspect your windows and doors for any weak spots to prevent water damage.
                </p>
                <h2>2. Trim Tree Branches and Clear Outdoor Items</h2>
                <h3>Why It’s Important:</h3>
                <p>
                    Overhanging branches and unsecured outdoor items can become dangerous projectiles in high winds, damaging your roof, windows, and even your car.
                </p>
                <h3>How to Trim and Clear Safely:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Trim Branches Near the House:</b> Focus on branches that could fall on your roof or windows, and prune them regularly.</li>
                    <li><b>Secure Outdoor Furniture and Decor:</b> Move any loose outdoor items like patio furniture, grills, or garden decor indoors or secure them properly.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <b>Bonus Tip:</b> Check with a professional arborist for trees that are especially close to your home.
                </p>
                <h2>3. Clean Gutters and Downspouts to Avoid Water Buildup</h2>
                <h3>Why It’s Important:</h3>
                <p>
                    Clogged gutters can lead to water pooling around your foundation, which may cause leaks, foundation shifts, or basement flooding. Cleaning them before storms can help water flow away from your home safely.
                </p>
                <h3>How to Clean Gutters Efficiently:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Remove Leaves and Debris:</b> Use gloves and a gutter scoop to clear out any build-up in the gutters.</li>
                    <li><b>Direct Downspouts Away from Your Home:</b> Make sure your downspouts lead water at least 5-10 feet away from your foundation to prevent water damage.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <b>Bonus Tip:</b> Install gutter guards to keep your gutters cleaner for longer, reducing the frequency of maintenance.
                </p>
                <h2>4. Inspect and Repair Your Roof for Potential Weak Points</h2>
                <h3>Why It’s Important:</h3>
                <p>
                    Your roof is your first line of defense against storms. Even minor damage can lead to leaks that affect your entire home. Regular roof checks and repairs are essential for storm preparedness.
                </p>
                <h3>How to Inspect Your Roof:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Check for Loose Shingles or Damaged Flashing:</b> Look for signs of wear or damage, particularly around chimneys and vents.</li>
                    <li><b>Consider a Temporary Roof Cover:</b> If you know your roof has weak points, consider installing a temporary cover for extra protection.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <b>Bonus Tip:</b> Regularly schedule a professional roof inspection, especially before storm season.
                </p>
                <h2>5. Elevate Valuables and Move Electronics to Higher Ground</h2>
                <h3>Why It’s Important:</h3>
                <p>
                    Flooding can be unpredictable, and even a small amount of water can ruin electronics, furniture, and valuable belongings. Moving these items to higher ground can prevent expensive replacements.
                </p>
                <h3>How to Protect Your Valuables:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Store Items on Upper Floors:</b> Move electronics, important documents, and valuables to higher levels, like an upstairs room or on high shelves.</li>
                    <li><b>Use Waterproof Containers:</b> Store essential documents and sentimental items in waterproof containers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <b>Bonus Tip:</b> Make digital copies of important documents and back them up online for extra security.
                </p>
                <h2>6. Address Basement and Foundation Vulnerabilities</h2>
                <h3>Why It’s Important:</h3>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://completerestoration.net/flooded-basement/"><u>Basements and foundations are highly susceptible to water damage.</u></a> Even small cracks can lead to leaks, mold, and structural issues, which can be very costly to repair.
                </p>
                <h3>How to Fortify Your Foundation and Basement:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Seal Foundation Cracks:</b> Use waterproof sealant on any visible cracks in your foundation.</li>
                    <li><b>Check Your Sump Pump:</b> If you have a sump pump, test it regularly, and consider installing a battery backup to keep it running in case of a power outage.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <b>Bonus Tip:</b> Consider adding a French drain or other drainage solutions to divert water away from your foundation.
                </p>
                <h2>7. Prepare an Emergency Kit with Key Contacts and Supplies</h2>
                <h3>Why It’s Important:</h3>
                <p>
                    Being prepared for any emergency is crucial, especially when facing a storm. A well-stocked emergency kit ensures you and your family have essential supplies if you need to shelter in place or evacuate.

                    <li><b>Water:</b> Pack at least one gallon of water per person per day, with a three-day supply as the minimum. If space allows, extra water for hygiene is also helpful.</li>
                    <li><b>Non-Perishable Food:</b> Aim for easy-to-eat, shelf-stable items like canned goods, energy bars, dried fruits, nuts, and instant meals. Remember to include a manual can opener.</li>
                    <li><b>Flashlight and Batteries:</b> A flashlight is essential for power outages, and extra batteries ensure you’ll have light for as long as you need it. Consider including headlamps to keep your hands free.</li>
                    <li><b>First-Aid Kit:</b> A well-stocked first-aid kit with bandages, antiseptic wipes, tweezers, adhesive tape, pain relievers, and any personal medications is crucial for minor injuries.</li>
